Swift - Random Fruit Picker

App created in Xcode 10.2.1 (10E1001) using Swift 4.2, iOS Deployment Target 12.2 and tested on a iPhone Xr Emulator

Fruit is always a yummy treat, but many times we dont know which one to choose. This app allows you to choose a random fruit
to eat. The fruits available in this app are: Apple, Bananas, Cherries, Grapes, Lemon, Orange, Pear & Strawberry.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Random Fruit Picker' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a white background with the title on top 'Random Fruit Picker', a large bowl of fruit in the center 
and a button below labeled 'Click to Pick'. The user clicks the 'Click to Pick ' button and a random fruit is selected and
displayed in name on top and in the body in graphic.
